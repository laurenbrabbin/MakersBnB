## Engineering Project I (Makersbnb)


This week you will:

1. Learn to work and communicate effectively as part of a team to build a web application.
2. Learn to break down projects into tasks and assign them to pairs.
3. Learn to use agile ceremonies to organise your work and improve your processes.
4. Learn to use the developer workflow to plan, implement and peer-review features.

## Project specification
We would like a web application that allows users to list spaces they have available, and to hire spaces for the night. Here are the must haves:


1. Any signed-up user can list a new space.
2. Users can list multiple spaces.
3. Users should be able to name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.
4. Users should be able to offer a range of dates where their space is available.
5. Any signed-up user can request to hire any space for one night, and this should be approved by the user that owns that space.
6. Nights for which a space has already been booked should not be available for users to book that space.
7. Until a user has confirmed a booking request, that space can still be booked for that night.
